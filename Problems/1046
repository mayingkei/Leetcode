1046. Last Stone Weight
We have a collection of stones, each stone has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose the two heaviest stones and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:

If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.
At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)

            reverse(stones.begin(),stones.end());
            
            stones[0] = stones[0] - stones[1];
            stones. erase(stones.begin() + 1);
            if(stones[0] == 0)
                stones. erase(stones.begin());
