883. Projection Area of 3D Shapes
On a N * N grid, we place some 1 * 1 * 1 cubes that are axis-aligned with the x, y, and z axes.

Each value v = grid[i][j] represents a tower of v cubes placed on top of grid cell (i, j).

Now we view the projection of these cubes onto the xy, yz, and zx planes.

A projection is like a shadow, that maps our 3 dimensional figure to a 2 dimensional plane. 

Here, we are viewing the "shadow" when looking at the cubes from the top, the front, and the side.

Return the total area of all three projections.

        for(int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++){
            int maxx = 0, maxy=0;
            for(int j = 0; j < grid[i].size();j++){
                if(grid[i][j] != 0)
                    z++;
                if(grid[i][j] > maxx)
                    maxx = grid[i][j];
                if(grid[j][i] > maxy)
                    maxy = grid[j][i];
            }
            x += maxx;
            y += maxy;
        }
        
        res = x+y+z;
