1051. Height Checker
Students are asked to stand in non-decreasing order of heights for an annual photo.

Return the minimum number of students that must move in order for all students to be standing in non-decreasing order of height.

Notice that when a group of students is selected they can reorder in any possible way between themselves and the non selected students remain on their seats.
