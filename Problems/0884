884. Uncommon Words from Two Sentences
We are given two sentences A and B.  (A sentence is a string of space separated words.  Each word consists only of lowercase letters.)

A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

Return a list of all uncommon words. 

You may return the list in any order.
