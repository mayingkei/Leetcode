771. Jewels and Stones
You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

class Solution {
public:
    int numJewelsInStones(string J, string S) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (char c: S) {
            for (char b: J) {
                if (b == c) {
                    ans += 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
